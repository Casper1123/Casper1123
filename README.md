Hello there.
I used to do amateur hobbyist programming but am now slowly getting into software engineering and computer science as an education.
Older code I wrote is almost certainly terrible.

If you need to reach out to me, please do so through Discord (Casper1123).
Thanks for your time and have a nice day.
